        <p>Our Aim is to Make Teenagers realise that they are capable of anything and everything. We want to make
            Entrepreneurship a term that can be recognised by every teen. Talking about students, they spend most of
            their time doing school based activities, and what we mean by school based activities is mostly studying,
            doing home works, completing assignments, going to hundred different coachings and stuff like that. These
            activities exhausts a student's mind due to which they get tired and don't work on other things or acquire
            new skills. Schools
            suppresses a student's creativity, and don't teach things which can be actually helpful in solving problems.
            SocioLearn is an online Entrepreneurship school which helps teenagers can learn about problem solving in
            depth and learn how to use their mind creatively. </p>
